# NLU-Quality-Check
Checks the quality of NLU performance by running NLU prediction API call for every test phrase from test_phrases.csv

This python script expects the following CSV file as input:
|test_phrase|expected_intent|
|---|---|
|hello|Hello|
|Good morning|Hello|
|human|Speak To a Human|

and produces the following CSV as output
|test_phrase|	detected_status|	expected_intent|	primary_intent|	all_intents|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|hello|	OK Primary|	Hello|	1434-**Hello**|	1434-Hello-0.9656
